            Quality health care delivery is delivering the right care, to the
            right patient, in the right manner, in the right place, at the right
            time, all the time. It is important for organizations like Oriental
            hospital to understand the six dimensions of quality health care,
            which are stated below in order to get it right. The six dimensions
            of quality health care are:-

            <li className="my-2">
              {" "}
              Effectiveness (no needless pain or suffering): - Making sure the
              patient doesnâ€™t go back the same way they came. Ask questions
              like, have we been able to alleviate the pain or suffering of our
              patients?

              Patient Centeredness (no helplessness in those served): - Have we

            <li className="my-2">

            </li>
            <li className="my-2">
              Efficiency (no waste): - Doctors should prescribe only the
              necessary drugs. Ask questions like, have we been able to solve
              the issues of poly-pharmacy in the hospital?

          <p className="my-4 text-gray-600">
            Our departmental goal is to ensure excellent health care delivery to
            our teeming patients. We are to monitor the processes and procedures
            of activities in different departments and also set up a quality
            improvement plan which includes trainings and workshops.
          </p>

          <p className="my-4 text-gray-600">
            For effectiveness, we put up a quality assurance team (Quality
            Champions) with a representation from various departments in the
            hospital. We put up a roster for monitoring, evaluation and training
            using a carefully designed monitoring and evaluation survey forms
            for assessment. This has been a huge success because we were able to
            identify some gaps responsible for lack of satisfaction in the
            services rendered to our patients. Also, we were able to identify
            the poor attitude of some staff towards the patients.
